# Hello World! üåç  

I‚Äôm **Devansh Prajapati**, better known in these parts as **DAR3D3V1L**. By day, I‚Äôm an AI/ML enthusiast crafting intelligent systems, and by night‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôm still an AI/ML enthusiast, but with the lights off. *Daredevil vibes, right?* I don‚Äôt let bugs or broken code slow me down‚Äîthey just make the fight more interesting. ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  

In my free time, I walk the fine line between genius and chaos (with Python as my billy club). My projects? Think of them as vigilantes of the tech world, combining intelligence and security to keep the digital streets safe. AI-driven creativity meets cyber-savvy innovation‚Äîjustice for bugs, villains, and lazy algorithms! üöÄ

## üíª Developer Extraordinaire  
*Justice is served one line of code at a time*  

- **Python?** My trusty sidekick. **Java?** My armor. **SQL?** The city I defend.  
- Linux servers fear me (and so do hackers). I make them run like well-oiled machines.  
- **AI & ML?** Building systems that learn, think, and sometimes act like me (hopefully without the sarcasm).  
- Projects include:
  - Real-time **face detection systems** (so you can‚Äôt hide in the shadows)  
  - **Navigation algorithms** (no running away)  
  - LMS platforms (because education saves the day)  
- Docker and Git? My grappling hooks for tech missions.

## üîß Projects I‚Äôm Proud Of  
*Code so sharp, it cuts crime*  

- **Job Portal:** Connecting talent with opportunities faster than I connect the dots in debugging.  
- **AI-Powered Document Converter:** Turning voices into documents‚Äîno need to plead the fifth.  
- **Face Detection System:** Real-time recognition. No mask can hide you now.  

---

## üé® Hobbies  
*When I‚Äôm not coding or saving the digital world:*  

- **Trekking in the mountains**‚Äîbecause even vigilantes need some fresh air. (And yes, I‚Äôm an orophile. üåÑ Fancy word, right?)  
- Occasionally, I try to debug life, but that‚Äôs way harder than debugging code.

## üéì Education  

Pursuing **B.Tech in CSE AI and ML** at **Galgotias University**. Essentially, I‚Äôm training to be the tech world‚Äôs Daredevil, minus the blindness but with all the grit.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  

- **Programming Languages:** Python (for agility), Java (for strength), SQL (for strategy)  
- **Frameworks:** Spring Boot (my iron fist), Flask (my nimble fingers)  
- **Tools & Platforms:** Docker, Git, Linux (my battle gear)  
- **Databases:** MySQL (optimized like Hell‚Äôs Kitchen streets)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap (because a hero also needs a good look)  
- **AI & ML:** Training models to be as sharp and relentless as me.  

---

When the bugs come crawling, I don‚Äôt just fix them‚ÄîI take them down. The city of code deserves a hero, and here I am. Together, let‚Äôs make tech smarter, safer, and a whole lot cooler. ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
